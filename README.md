TAILS OF TWO

#This game was developed in 2 days! Not much time for us, and game development was a new experience for most of the team. However, we placed 58/164 in our game jam, which is not bad for a first game lol!
Anyways, had lots of fun making this game, learned a lot, and we hope its enjoyable. :)
